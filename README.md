# AI Programming with Python Project

# Introduction 
This repo is part of the project submission for the Udacity nano degree program "AI Programming with Python".
The purpose of the project is to first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.


# Project Instructions for running the code on your local machine
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it
3. Install the dependencies using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Work on Jupyter notebook "Image Classifier Project.ipynb"
5. Or use `train.py` and `predict.py` to run the command line application. Use with -h argument to see the available arguments
